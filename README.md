# stable_matching_sortinghat
This code prompts people's Harry Potter house preferences and matches them with a house using the stable matching algorithm. :)

Have you ever wondered what Harry Potter house you belong to?
Well, now you can find out!!

WHAT IT DOES:
This code takes in information from four people about their Harry Potter housing preference.
Then you will take a short quiz, which will determine the houses' preferences for each person.
The program will match you to each house (based off of the houses' preferences) using the stable matching algorithm.

WHAT TO DO:
Get four people to take this quiz!

For each person:
Enter your first name.
List your housing preferences in order.
Answer each of the 4 quiz questions.

After all four people are done with the quiz, you will be matched to your house! :D
